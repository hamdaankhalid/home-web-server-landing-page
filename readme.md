# What?

I don't often ask for the "why" when building stuff, but this time I had a why! I finally wanted to just write something in Go.
I also thought this was a great opportunity to write something I will run on my home webserver! Along with backing it up with my own database.
Overtime I will keep making this more and more complicated till my raspberry pi crashes.
